## Objective🏆:

This repository contain codes i have written in my course of data structure  and as  practice.
The main goal is to keep the track of my progress and understand and practice new programming concepts.
## LAB-01 – Polynomial Class 💻

My first lab was focused on implementing a **Polynomial class**.  
Writing code for the first time in the DSA course challenged my programming skills  
and pushed me to think outside the box.

### What I Learned
- Representing a polynomial using arrays or linked lists  
- Implementing core operations:
  - Addition  
  - Subtraction  
  - Evaluation  
  - Displaying polynomial  
- Understanding dynamic memory handling  
- Applying object-oriented programming concepts  

### Reflection
This lab strengthened my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.  
It helped me build confidence and prepared me for the upcoming, more advanced labs.
## LAB-02 – NDArray Class 📦

The second lab focused on building an **NDArray (N-Dimensional Array) Class**,  
which strengthened my understanding of how multi-dimensional structures work internally.  
This lab required converting N-dimensional indexing into a **linear 1D memory layout**,  
which pushed me to think about memory mapping, indexing formulas, and clean class design.

### What I Learned
- How N-dimensional arrays are stored in a single contiguous 1D array  
- Implementing row-major index mapping  
- Designing a class with:
  - Dynamic dimensions  
  - Set and Get functions  
  - Index validation  
  - Print function  
- Understanding how multi-dimensional indexing translates into a single integer position  
- Applying templates for generic data types  

### Reflection
This lab helped me deeply understand how arrays work beneath the surface.  
It improved my problem-solving skills, strengthened my C++ fundamentals,  
and prepared me for more advanced data structures in future labs.
Writing the Polynomial class for the first time pushed me to think logically, break problems into smaller parts, and understand how mathematical structures can be represented in code.
It strengthened my confidence and prepared me for more complex labs that followed.
